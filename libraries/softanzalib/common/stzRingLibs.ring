# lightguilib.ring" takes most of the time made by non-Softanza libraries

#TODO
# Replace with "ringqtcorelib.ring" when included in future Ring.

      // test it with:
      // load "../libraries/guilib/classes/ring_qtcore.ring"
      // loadlib("ringqt_core.dll")
      // But don't keep it because we will not be able to use load "guilib.ring" or "lightguilib.ring"
