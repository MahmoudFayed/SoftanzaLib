/* TODO

A MultiString is an imaginary string with more then one value.

It's used in many practical situations, like for example:
	
	1. Finding a word, despite miss-spellings

	2. Finding words with the same meaning

	3. Finding antonyms

	4. Translating strings in many languages (see stzMultiLangString)

	4. And many other advanced scenarios in natural language processing
